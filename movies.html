                I spent quite a bit less time in the cinema than in 2018
                which was definitely my “year of films”. I stopped my
                habit of going to the cinema regularly. However, I kept
                listening to BBC’s film podcast and did discover some
                gems throughout 2024.

                        This was the best film of the year for me.
                        Everyone should see this. I walked away from the cinema and had that rare
                        “this is why I love film!” moment. </p>

                        In early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne occupies
                        the throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah, governs the
                        country in her stead. When a new servant, Abigail, arrives, her
                        charm endears her to Sarah. Yorgos Lanthimos's films are usually too weird for me,
                        but this one is good fun.

                        own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for
                        Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.
                        Due to the hype I had a lot of expectations. Mark Kermode says that your experience
                        of a film is determined by what you bring to it. I brought a half year of sim racing
                        and this definitely influenced my views. But at 2.5hrs length, it flies by quite fast
                        and is definitely good fun.
