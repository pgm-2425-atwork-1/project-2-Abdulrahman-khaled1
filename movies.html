                <h1>My favorite <span>Movies</span></h1>
                <p> I spent quite a bit less time in the cinema than in 2018 
                    which was definitely my “year of films”. I stopped my 
                    habit of going to the cinema regularly. However, I kept 
                    listening to BBC’s film podcast and did discover some 
                    gems throughout 2024.</p>

                    <p class="movie-description">German artist Kurt Barnert has escaped East Germany and 
                        now lives in West Germany, but is tormented by his childhood 
                        under the Nazis and the GDR-regime.
                         This was the best film of the year for me. Everyone should 
                        see this. I walked away from the cinema and had that rare 
                        “this is why I love film!” moment.</p>

                        small mistake derails their lives forever.
                         Somewhat slow but beautifully portrayed.</p>

                        performance at Live Aid (1985).
                         I wasn't a fan of Queen before, but now I am.</p>

                    <p class="movie-description">   In early 18th century England, a frail Queen Anne occupies 
                        the throne and her close friend, Lady Sarah, governs the 
                        country in her stead. When a new servant, Abigail, arrives, her 
                        charm endears her to Sarah.
                         Yorgos Lanthimos's films are usually too weird for me, but 
                        this one is good fun.</p>

                    <p class="movie-description">  American car designer Carroll Shelby and driver Ken Miles 
                        battle corporate interference, the laws of physics and their 
                        own personal demons to build a revolutionary race car for 
                        Ford and challenge Ferrari at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1966.
                         Due to the hype I had a lot of expectations. Mark Kermode 
                        says that your experience of a film is determined by what 
                        you bring to it. I brought a half year of sim racing and this 
                        definitely influenced my views. But at 2.5hrs length, it flies by 
                        quite fast and is definitely good fun.</p>

                         This film got poor reviews but I cannot not like a film with 
                        Saiorse Ronan. Check out the soundtrack by Max Richter as 
                        well.</p>

                        between the U.S. and Mexico.
                         Yes, I know this film is from 2015; but I discovered why it's 
                        good this year.</p>
